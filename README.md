# Streamlit Weather App (Animated)

A clean weather app built with **Streamlit** using **OpenWeatherMap**.  
Shows current conditions and a 5–day outlook. The background gradient and subtle animations adapt to the **current** weather (rain/snow/clear/etc.).

## Features
- City input (no auto geolocation).
- Current weather with icon, temperature, humidity, wind.
- Sunrise/sunset, coordinates, pressure, visibility.
- 5-day aggregated forecast (daily average temperature; icon sampled near mid–day).
- Dynamic background:
  - **Rain/Drizzle/Thunderstorm** → rainy overlay animation.
  - **Snow** → snow overlay animation.
  - **Clear/Clouds/Mist** → themed gradients.
- Minimal glassmorphism UI.
